This is the current development of the kill streak plugin.

For now this plugin only counts player streaks and runs a command when a player reaches a set number off kills.

For info on how the config works, open the config.yml from the github, all comments are in there.

Commands:

+ "/ks" -- shows your kill streak.
+ "/ks [player]" -- shows player's streak.
+ "/ks help" -- shows help.
+ "/ks config" -- shows config help.
+ "/ks kills" -- shows kills help.
