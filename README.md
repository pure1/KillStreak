This is the current development of the kill streak plugin.

For now this plugin only counts player streaks and runs a command when a player reaches a set number off kills.

For info on how the config works, open the config.yml from the github, all comments are in there.

Commands:

"/ks" -- shows your kill streak.

"/ks config get commands" lists the commands that will be run and when.
